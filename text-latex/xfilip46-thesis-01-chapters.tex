\chapter{Introduction}

When we look at cryptocurrency, there is a very lucrative market. That's why people have always found new ways to make money from trading cryptocurrencies. There are many trading strategies for cryptocurrencies available, but no such strategy survives both rising (bull) and falling (bear) market. That's why there is a need for adaptive strategies.

I'll explore the idea of the adaptive trading strategies for cryptocurrencies in this thesis. Firstly we need to find a way how to predict if the market will go up or down. Then we need to apply sufficient trading strategies regarding the percentual probability of market going up or down.

\chapter{Trading Strategies for Cryptocurrencies}

There are various trading strategies available regarding cryptocurrencies.
In this chapter I'll go through those that are considered the most well-known and consider
their ups and downs.

ASSIGNMENT: Study existing trading strategies for cryptocurrencies and other instruments, including rebalance and HODL. Analyze achieved results of the studied strategies and their assumptions.

\section{HODL}

This is the strategy that is one of the most prominent in the cryptocurrency market.
It is jokingly derived from mispelling of the word "hodl" \cite{investopedia-hodl}.
